# Propublica-Data-Analysis

This project looked a dataset on expenditures by the U.S. House Members in the Congress in last ten years. The dataset is available 
here: https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures
This project was done as a part of a data science competition by The Data Incubator, in which I was a semi-finalist.
